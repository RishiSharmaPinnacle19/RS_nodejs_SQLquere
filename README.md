########## NODE.js With MySQL ##########

The code connects a Node.js application to a MySQL database using the `mysql` module. It creates a database, a `school` table, and alters the table by adding an `id` column and modifying the `class` column. It then inserts multiple student records into the table.

The code performs several SQL operations, including selecting all data, selecting specific columns, filtering with `WHERE`, sorting with `ORDER BY`, deleting rows, updating records, and limiting the number of results with `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`. It demonstrates a range of basic CRUD operations and SQL queries in a Node.js environment.
